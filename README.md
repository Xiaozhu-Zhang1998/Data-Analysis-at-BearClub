The showcase of several data analysis cases, provided by the Chinese data think tank, BearClub（狗熊会）, sponsored by Prof. Hansheng Wang in Peking University.

I got access to these cases due to the cooperation between Dept. of Statistics in Hunan University and BearClub, through which I wrote R codes to investigate, complete and further the basic framework given by BearClub. **All files are written in Chinese.**
